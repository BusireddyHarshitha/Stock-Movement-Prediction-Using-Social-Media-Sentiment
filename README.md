# Stock-Movement-Prediction-Using-Social-Media-Sentiment
"Predict stock movements by analyzing the pulse of social media! Harness sentiment analysis to uncover trends, correlate public opinion with market data, and stay ahead in the financial game."
Introduction
Social media platforms are treasure troves of real-time sentiment data. This project leverages sentiment analysis to evaluate public opinion about specific stocks and correlates it with historical stock price data to predict stock movements.

Objective
Analyze social media sentiment to understand public opinion about stocks.
Use sentiment scores and historical stock data to predict stock price changes.
Features
Sentiment Analysis:

Analyze public sentiment using the VADER Sentiment Analyzer.
Score social media posts (positive, neutral, negative).
Stock Data Integration:

Retrieve historical stock data from financial APIs.
Combine stock data with aggregated sentiment scores.
Prediction Model:

Train and evaluate models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict stock price movements.
Visualization:

Plot correlations between sentiment trends and stock prices.
Show prediction results with charts.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries:

Data Processing: pandas, numpy
Sentiment Analysis: nltk (VADER Sentiment Analyzer)
Financial Data: yfinance or alpha_vantage
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
APIs:

Social media data (e.g., Twitter API, Reddit API).
Stock market data (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).


Workflow
Data Collection:

Fetch social media data related to a stock (e.g., mentions of "AAPL").
Retrieve corresponding historical stock price data.
Sentiment Analysis:

Use the VADER Sentiment Analyzer to compute sentiment scores for social media posts.
Data Aggregation:

Combine sentiment scores with stock price data (daily or hourly).
Model Training:

Use supervised learning models to predict stock price movements based on sentiment.
Evaluation and Visualization:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualize results using plots.
